This is the model for DX.1, the folder "Modules" contain all of the parts that were embedded inside of the main shell to make it as sleek as possible. I have provided them here so that you can add them to your own design.

DX.1 isnt meant to be a full design however still part of an experimental build, note that this was superceded by DX.2.
