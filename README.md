I've started by build here, slowly the README.md's will be filled with tutorials/better information.
Everything here is subject to change and will improve slowly with time.

As you can see, the repo is called Synth Head DX, meaning its the repo where I work on the synth head (specifically the DX series). When I do development on the full suit, this repo will be mentioned however it will be seperate as the head is too complicated to leave it in 1 repo.
